#What is the point of this repo
This repo exists so as to assist KamiLimu cohort 8 mentees develop a good understanding on the data structures covered in Dr. Chao's 'Problem Solving using Data Structures' sessions.
However, this repo is not limited to just those sessions. One has the freedom to add the implementaion for any data structure they deem useful.

This repo is also meant to serve as a practice area for using git and github. For reference, kindly refer to the Alan sessions/notes in the resource folder. You're also free to ask fellow mentees or the great Alan, himself.
